  (Introduction
    (What is L15P?
      (My attempt at implementing LISP as close as possible to the original
        specification.)))

  (Running
    (Installation
      (To install, run:

        make && make install
        
       which will build the source and install the executable in the standard
       directory.)

      (Running
        (To run, use:

          l15p
        
         To exit, type quit:
       
          >>> quit)))

    (Examples
        (You can find example code in the 'lisp.lisp' file. This can be
         copy/pasted into the running L15P interpreter. The aim of the script is
         to create a functioning LISP interpreter written in LISP, and to run it
         within the L15P environment. Most of the code is taken from Paul
         Graham's paper, 'The Roots of Lisp':
