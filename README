  (Introduction
    (What is L15P?
      (My attempt at implementing LISP as close as possible to the original
        specification.)))

  (Running
    (Installation
      (To install, run:

        make && make install
        
       which will build the source and install the executable in the standard
       directory.)

    (Running)
      (To run, use:

        l15p
        
       To exit, type quit:
       
        >>> quit
        
       ))))
